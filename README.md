===============

GIS Extension Model for the Virtual Repository.

The extension model includes a basic implementation of the OGC approved GeoAPI standard Feature API. This extension is used in the [virtual-ows](https://github.com/virtual-repository/virtual-ows) module, to allow fetching features from WFS FeatureType assets.
